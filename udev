    ""Details""
 Package : udev
Device Manager for the Linux Kernel
Manages devices nodes(permissions, symlinks[example: to know if I have many usb (which one is which)], rename) in /Dev
##it is successor of devfs and hotplug in kernel 2.4
when I attach or remove devices, some actions will be performed
Dynamically creates&removes devices files
provides consistent naming
provides a user spce API
All details for the device can be found under /sys since kernel 2.6

        "" How it works ""
Device attached
Kernel detects it and sysfs is populated with device details.
Udev receives devices uevent from kernel
Udev matched its rules "/etc/udev/ruled.d/*.rules" against various device attributes to identify the device and create meaningful symlinks, jset permissions, rename device or run a script.
'''

1 --> logout and the login to iscsi to check the device name
2 --> use two sessions one to login and the other to monitor
  udevadm monitor --env
  login iscsi again = or logout
  >> Monitor: Actions, subsystem, kernel, subsystem
3 --> Query all data about device:
  >> udevadm info --query=all --path=(/sys)/block/sdf/
    E = environment
    P = path
    S = symlink --> ll /psth to symlink
    N = name
4 --> cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
    > copy from another rule file (number means periority)
    --- Look at the book
    example: 
    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{ID_SCSI_SERIAL}=="***", SYMLINK+="myscsi%n"
    ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{ID_SCSI_SERIAL}=="***", RUN+="/bin/mount /iscsi"

yum install lvm2-cluster
NOTE :  connecting to cluster manager (cman)
chkconfig clvmd on

LM : Look management is needed on any system to avoid inconsist data (like if you editing file and someone opens it will show him error)
DLM : Distributed Look Management
    Allow nodes to access their shared storage and syncronizing the rgmanager service status
    if we don't have DLM we may have inconsist data.
    syncronize the information about which process are trying which file but in cluster case it is resources instead of files
    
CLVM: it has the ability to lock the LVM wich is accessed by another node
    example:
        I am tring to resize the lv and in the same time from another node trying to delete this lv
        
        
Practise : 
===========
1- create lvm
2- vim /etc/lvm/lvm.conf
    change : locking_type = 3
3- ps -ef | grep -i dlm --> check for dlm_controld
4- service clvmd restart
5- chkconfig clvmd on
6- after creating lv we can try to remove it from both nodes

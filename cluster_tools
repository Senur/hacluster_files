ccs --> can be installed on the node which has ricci installed

-every time you configure cluster.conf file you need to update the version value.
two_node=1 ---> to prevent split brain

------------------
Conga --> luci and ricci
cluster suite --> rgmanager, luci, ricci, cman, corosync and others.

Major Component of the Cluster:
===============================
-Cluster Infrastructure.
-HighAvailability service management.
-Redhat GFS2 (Global File System)
-clvmd (Cluster Logical Volume Management).
-Global Network Block Device (GNBD) --- ISCSI
-Cluster Administration tools.

=====================================
*Cluster will be qurated if 50% of nodes are up and running.
=====================================

*We need luci for the gui management otherwise we can ignore it or install it on any cluster node to not waste resources.
*And Luci can manage more than one cluster.

cman should be present on every single node: 
    check wither the node still online or not
    
fence: we need it to make a fence because shared stoage should not be accessable by more than one node.
    fence should be immediatlely to not make any corruption of data on the shared storage

whenever cman becomes not responsive so it is going to fence this node(deattach the shared storage and doing some kind of hard reboot) and decide to reboot it

Network Power Switch:
    is a power switch which connected to all nodes and make use of fencing to to switch off or reboot the node

Requirements:
================
-Up to 16 node, but any cluster with 8 nodes or more, will needs to be subjected to an architecture review to determine supportability.

-Single Site.---> for multisite or stretch clusters (geo clusters):contact redhat support first.
-Supported fencing HW :
    *can be power fencing or storage fencing or combination of both.
    *fencing is required for all nodes in the cluster.
    *be sure to choose a appropriate fence device before building the cluster:
        Please contact REDHAT for the updated list.
        
-No single point of failuer (every node has more than one NIC)
-MultiplePath from the node to the shared storage
-Only one node should access (mounted) the shared stoage.
-NetworkMnager = Disabled
-Network Switches should support Multicasting and IGMP.
    because the communications between cman on all nodes is using multicasting and IGMP.
    
-APCI(Advanced Power Configuration Interface) should be disabled on BIOS on every node ---> if not disable when the cluster try to shut this node it will lead to (safe shutdown) and this will take some time [Problem is the mounted shared storage in it] ==> We may need to add kernel parameter in grub.conf (acpi=off)
***** Specially if you are using ILO or DRAC, you must make powers off immediatlely when shutdown signal is recieved.
(chkconfig acpid off)

- On RHEL6 only virtualmachines using KVM hypervisor are supported as a cluster resources.

-NetworkPorts:
    UDP:
        5404, 5405  corosync, cman
    TCP:
        11111, 21064, 16861 ricci, dlm, modclusterd
